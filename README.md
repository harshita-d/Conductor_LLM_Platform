## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Requirements

- `fastapi`: FastAPI is the web framework that creates your REST API endpoints.
- `uvicorn[standard]`: Uvicorn is the ASGI server that runs your FastAPI application.
- `pydantic`: 
   - Validates that users send correct data format
   - Automatically converts JSON ↔ Python objects
   - Generates interactive API docs, 
   - Catches data errors before they cause problems
   - FastAPI can work without Pydantic, but you lose most of its benefits. 
   - FastAPI is designed around Pydantic and works best with it.
- `python-dotenv`: 
   - it's the easiest and most convenient way to manage environment variables during development.
- `google-generativeai`: 
   - Google Generative AI is Google's official SDK for accessing Gemini AI models.
   - Connects to Google's Gemini AI models
   - Handles authentication with Google's servers
   - Provides easy-to-use Python interface
   - Manages API calls and responses
- `httpx`:
   - HTTPX is an async HTTP client for making API calls to external services.
   - good with fastAPI
